# U-Mind
This project was created for the course "Augmented Reality &amp; Virtual Reality".

This is a VR experience for people with social anxiety. The goal is to determine which elements can be triggering for them. 

The player has to go through 3 different social situations :

1) The Coffee Shop
2) The Classroom
3) The House Party

In each room, the player is asked to fill out a form on his symptoms and the element that could be the reason for these symptoms.
